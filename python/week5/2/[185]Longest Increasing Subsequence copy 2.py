Longest Increasing Subsequence
Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "cat" is a subsequence of "crabt".
Example 1:

Input: nums = [9,1,4,2,3,3,7]

Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [1,2,3,7], which has a length of 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,1,3,2,3]

Output: 4
