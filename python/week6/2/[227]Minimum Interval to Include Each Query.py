'''
Minimum Interval to Include Each Query
You are given a 2D integer array intervals, where intervals[i] = [left_i, right_i] represents the ith interval starting at left_i and ending at right_i (inclusive).

You are also given an integer array of query points queries. The result of query[j] is the length of the shortest interval i such that left_i <= queries[j] <= right_i. If no such interval exists, the result of this query is -1.

Return an array output where output[j] is the result of query[j].

Note: The length of an interval is calculated as right_i - left_i + 1.

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,7],[6,6]], queries = [2,3,1,7,6,8]

Output: [2,2,3,5,1,-1]
Explanation:

Query = 2: The interval [2,3] is the smallest one containing 2, it's length is 2.
Query = 3: The interval [2,3] is the smallest one containing 3, it's length is 2.
Query = 1: The interval [1,3] is the smallest one containing 1, it's length is 3.
Query = 7: The interval [3,7] is the smallest one containing 7, it's length is 5.
Query = 6: The interval [6,6] is the smallest one containing 6, it's length is 1.
Query = 8: There is no interval containing 8.
