Reverse Integer
You are given a signed 32-bit integer x.

Return x after reversing each of its digits. After reversing, if x goes outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then return 0 instead.

Solve the problem without using integers that are outside the signed 32-bit integer range.

Example 1:

Input: x = 1234

Output: 4321
Example 2:

Input: x = -1234

Output: -4321
Example 3:

Input: x = 1234236467

Output: 0
