Multiply Strings
You are given two strings num1 and num2 that represent non-negative integers.

Return the product of num1 and num2 in the form of a string.

Assume that neither num1 nor num2 contain any leading zero, unless they are the number 0 itself.

Note: You can not use any built-in library to convert the inputs directly into integers.

Example 1:

Input: num1 = "3", num2 = "4"

Output: "12"
Example 2:

Input: num1 = "111", num2 = "222"

Output: "24642"
