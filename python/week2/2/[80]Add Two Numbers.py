Add Two Numbers
You are given two non-empty linked lists, l1 and l2, where each represents a non-negative integer.

The digits are stored in reverse order, e.g. the number 123 is represented as 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> in the linked list.

Each of the nodes contains a single digit. You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Return the sum of the two numbers as a linked list.

Example 1:



Input: l1 = [1,2,3], l2 = [4,5,6]

Output: [5,7,9]

Explanation: 321 + 654 = 975.
Example 2:

Input: l1 = [9], l2 = [9]

Output: [8,1]
